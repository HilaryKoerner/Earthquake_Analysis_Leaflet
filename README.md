# Earthquake Analysis using Leaflet

The challenge for this assignment was to create a map that displayed earthquake data pulled from the USGS website of earthquake data. I looked at all earthquakes occuring in the last seven days. 

I started by crateing a map layer and pulling in openstreet map. I created functions that would bind a popup, assign color based on depth, and a function that would place the bubble markers based on depth and magnitude to the map. Finally, I added a legend that coordinates with the range of colors and depths.
